# Genus1
This repository contains the classification of modular curves upto genus 1 in terms of families. 

It also contains a set of codes for the computation of models of modular curves upto genus 1. 
The main function is `FindModelNew` in the file main.m in the folder `FindingFamilies/MainCode`. Make sure that your directory is `FindingFamilies/MainCode`.

Apparently the data file is too big so I couldnot upload it in the original upload. I will figure something out.
