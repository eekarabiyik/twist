S,AbsoluteJmap,"This is an adjusted version of LMFDB's AbsoluteJmap. It works for Zywina's new code. To do: Elliptic curve case, i.e. when the modular curve X_G has genus 1. To do: Relative jmaps. Case by case. Remember that the relative jmaps between to canonical models are easy to deal with. To do: How I handle precision",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,270,,371,82,148,82,270,148

S,FindRatio,"Warning: this function is still very experimental! Input: Modular curves M and M0 corresponding to open subgroups G and G0 of GL(2,Zhat), respectively. Assume that G0:=[pm I G] We assume that model of X_G0 is already computed Output: With respect to their model, we give two homomogenous polynomials that corresponds to f^2/E6 where f is a modular form of weight three and E6 is the normal E6. Suppose that the parameter ""homogenous"" is set to false and the model of X_G or X_G0 is not canonical. Then a tuple of the form [1,F_1,...,F_n] is returned with F_i in the function field of X_G. Clearing denominators will give a tuple of homogenous polynomials as above. The function works by computing these F_i first and this express may me nicer for many purposes. The parameters ""prec0"" and ""prec_delta"" are for initial precision and how much to increase it when more is needed; these should be left alone at first. The parameters ""Id"" and ""mon1"" should be left alone; they are for keeping computations when we apply the function recursively",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,,0,0,-1,,0,0,-1,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
