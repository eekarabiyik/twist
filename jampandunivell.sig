S,MissingMonomials,"Finds the monomials of degree 2..maxd that are not contained in the monomial ideal I. Returns a sequence M so that the missing monomials of degree d can be accessed by M[d]. Note that M[1] = [], regardless of I",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,,0,0,-1,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,AbsoluteJmap,"This is an adjusted version of LMFDB's AbsoluteJmap. It works for Zywina's new code. To do: Elliptic curve case, i.e. when the modular curve X_G has genus 1. To do: Relative jmaps. Case by case. Remember that the relative jmaps between to canonical models are easy to deal with. To do: How I handle precision",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,270,,371,82,148,82,270,148
