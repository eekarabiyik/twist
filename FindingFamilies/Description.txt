-This is an early version of my twisting code that classifies modualr curves up to genus 6. No j-map is included. The resulting polynomials have unnecessary cubic relations sometimes.
-There might be mistakes, however, I am testing this on huge amounts of data. 
-This is pretty fast, much much faster than the previous version.


-load the main.m file. Make sure the directory is MainCode. The main function is FindModelNew. It takes a group G and its SL2 intersection T as inputs.
-An example file is included. 

-This entire repository will be updated a bunch. Let me know if you have any ideas, questions, suggestions.
-Data Files can be and will be made better: It will have less file size hopefully.

The families here are not minimal. They even contain "families" of fine modular curves i.e. -I \notin G.

The necessary code that finds/computes the families from the Cummings-Pauli Data will be added. 
There are unnecessary files. Please ignore them. A final version will be here once I figure out which version of functions make more sense.
