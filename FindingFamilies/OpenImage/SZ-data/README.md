This folder contains code and data from the paper "Modular curves of prime-power level with infinitely many rational points" by Andrew Sutherland and David Zywina.

In particular, it enumerates all the subgroups G of GL(2,Zhat), up to conjugacy, with prime power level that contain -I, have full determinant, X_G has genus at most 1, and X_G has a rational point when it has genus 0.   We use these groups as a starting point for our computations (the rest of the code here is needed to access these groups).
