H: A representative in the family F(calG,G)=F(calG,B) for some B arising from our calculations. Check Zywina-Explicit Open Image-Chapter 14 for details. G: A group in the family F(calG,G). This will be the group we are trying to compute the modular curve of. T: SL2 intersection of H AOfMF: an associative array with keys the integers from 1 to the number of generators for the automorphism group of calG, and values the images of these elements as // TODO Note that G and H are in the reverse order from the prior version GroupToCocycle Output: xi: Gal(K/Q)-> GL(#M`F0,K) 1-cocycle arising from the map H-> calG/G K: a number field GAL1: the Galois group of Gal(K/Q) as an automorphism group sigma1: the map from GAL1 to the set of automorphisms of K",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,457,,0,0,178,,0,0,178,,0,0,178,,0,0,178,,141,27,224,175,-38,-38
