S,TwistCurve,"Input: - M: a modular curve in the sense of Zywina. - xi: Gal(K/Q)-> GL(M`genus,K) 1-cocycle. This is a cocycle that extends from the Aut(M) (usually via AutomorphismOfModularForms function of Zywina). - K: the number field through which K factors - calG: calG is the group which contains G as a normal group and F(calG,G) is the family that G lies in. Output: - a sequence ""psi"" of homogeneous polynomials in Q[x_1,..,x_#M`F0], defining the twisted curve. - the H90 matrix used - the size of the H90 matrix, which is the same as #M`F0",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,178,,0,0,27,,0,0,141,,0,0,270,,82,177,148,-38,-38,-38
