S,TwistCurve,"Input: - M: a modular curve in the sense of Zywina. - xi: Gal(K/Q)-> GL(M`genus,K) 1-cocycle. This is a cocycle that extends from the Aut(M) (usually via AutomorphismOfModularForms function of Zywina). - K: the number field through which K factors - redcube: if this is true simplified cubics are produced. It is suggested that this is almost always set to true. Output: - a sequence ""psi"" of homogeneous polynomials in Q[x_1,..,x_#M`F0], defining the twisted curve. - the H90 matrix used - the size of the H90 matrix, which is the same as #M`F0",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-24,,0,0,141,,0,0,270,,82,177,148,-38,-38,-38
