S,FindModel,"Input: - G is a subgroup of GL2(Zhat). It is given by a subgroup of GL2(Z/NZ) where N is a multiple of the level of G. - T is the intersection of G with SL2(Z/NZ) Keywords: - redcub, whether to reduce the cubics (passed on to TwistCurve) - test_hyperelliptic, test if X_G is hyperelliptic over Q Output: - psi: homogeneous polynomials in Q[x_1,..x_n] defining the curve X_G mentioned above. n depends on the model of the family representative used to twist G from. - MAT: H90 matrix describing the twist from the family representative to G. - a sequence of length 2 giving the numerator and denominator of the absolute j-map - a boolean, whether X_G is hyperelliptic over Q (only returned if test_hyperelliptic is true) - the genus of X_G",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,,0,0,82,,0,0,178,,0,0,178,,82,177,82,36,148,-1
